**`Full-Stack Developer | JavaScript Whisperer | Sleepless @ IIIT Ranchi`**

By day, I'm a CSE undergrad navigating deadlines. By night, I turn caffeine into full-stack apps that occasionally work on the first try. I specialize in building modern, high-speed applications using **Next.js**, **MERN**, **Flask**, and sheer panic. If it's got an acronym or version number in it, I've probably broken it once.

  *A micro-blogging platform for macro opinions.*  
  > ⚡ Built with Vite because “vite” sounds fast | 🔐 JWT so secure even *you* might not get in | 💾 MERN stack because LAMP is for archaeologists

 ### 🧠 Technical Skills (Or: “Tech Stack or Pokémon? You decide.”)
I’ve spent years mastering the most powerful spells... I mean, technologies. Below is my complete stack — 100% real, partially evolved, possibly battle-ready:

```
Node · Onyx · Redux · React · Flask · Arcjet · Dratini · Zod · Zygarde  
Postgre · Mongodb · RhydonCLI · Supabase · Victini · Prisma · Express · Tailwind  
JWT · Clerk · HTML5 · CSS3 · TypeScript · Porygon-Z · Framer-Motion  
Next.js · GraphQL · MetaGrossQL	 · Kabuto · Mongoose · Vite · ShadCN · LuxRay  
C++ · Python · C · Recharts · NeonDB · Validator.js · bcrypt · Salamence  
Cloudinary · Gemini API · SQL · Arcjet · Clerk · GS.js · HTML
```

#### 🎯 Challenge:
- few of these are Pokémon
- few are tech tools

### 🏆 Achievements (or why I’m crying happy tears)

- 🥈 **AIR 2** in *SourceCode 2024*, IIT Kharagpur — almost number one, but my keyboard betrayed me

- 🍜 *CodeChef*: 3⭐ Coder, global ranks 394, 470, 692 — officially better at food-themed platforms than cooking

### 🎓 Education

**Indian Institute of Information Technology, Ranchi**  
*B.Tech in “How to Fix Bugs at 3 AM”* (Expected 2026)
